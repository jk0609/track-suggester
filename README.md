# Track Suggester (Week 2 Intro Project)

#### By Jonathon Kang

## Description

Exercise in HTML forms and Javascript/JQuery. Answer the questions on the right side and the page will show you a recommended coding language to pursue that best fits your priorities.

Answers are assigned numerical point values that are added and organized into 4 categorical variables. Nested if/else statements on the point values determine which hidden answer to reveal to the user. A mix of selection questions (options range from strongly disagree-strongly agree) and true/false radio input questions implemented as tie-breakers.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone the repository and open the index.html file in a browser of your choice. Make sure not to move any of the images or additional folders in the directory.
